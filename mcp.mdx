# **1. Executive Summary**

The **SINT MCP Marketplace** is an advanced platform for managing and executing Modular Cloud Programs (MCPs). It is designed for high-security applications where modular, on-demand cloud logic must be discoverable and executable by authenticated users or AI agents. The system integrates advanced security models, serverless execution, developer-friendly onboarding, and future Web3 and edge computing capabilities.

### **Key Capabilities:**

- **Confidential Execution**: Hardware-backed compute enclaves (AWS Lambda, KMS encryption, IAM isolation).
- **Zero Trust Security**: Multi-layer authentication, granular token scoping, and audit logging.
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling serverless infrastructure with provisioned concurrency for low-latency use cases.
- **Extensible API-first Approach**: OpenAPI specifications for each MCP.
- **Developer and AI Agent Support**: Ready for autonomous agents and human developers.

## **2. System Architecture**

### **2.1 Layered Design**

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - Web (Next.js) UI, CLI tools, chatbot interfaces.
   - Handles login, service connections, and MCP invocation.
2. **API Gateway Layer**
   - AWS API Gateway routes and validates requests.
   - Uses Cognito/Keycloak JWT validation.
3. **Orchestration & Business Logic Layer**
   - Node.js microservice managing routing, session tokens, scope validation, and MCP matching.
4. **Execution Layer**
   - AWS Lambda, one per MCP for strict isolation.
   - Stateless runtime for ephemeral execution.
5. **Data Layer**
   - PostgreSQL for metadata and relational data.
   - DynamoDB for fast lookups and caching.
   - AWS Secrets Manager for encrypted token storage.
6. **Monitoring & Logging Layer**
   - CloudWatch (logs and metrics), Datadog (dashboards), X-Ray (distributed tracing).

### **2.2 Core Interaction Flow**

1. User logs in through Keycloak → obtains JWT session token.
2. User connects a service (e.g., Google) → OAuth token stored in encrypted vault.
3. User selects MCP → system verifies required scopes.
4. MCP request routed through API Gateway → Lambda invoked.
5. Lambda executes business logic using scoped tokens.
6. Result returned, logged, and metrics updated.

## **3. Security Model**

### **3.1 Authentication & Authorization**

- **Identity Provider**: Keycloak, configured for OAuth 2.1 PKCE.
- **Session Tokens**: Short-lived JWT with refresh token rotation.
- **Third-Party Tokens**: Separate encrypted storage per user/service.
- **Access Scopes**: MCP-specific scope declarations enforced at runtime.

### **3.2 Execution Isolation**

- Each MCP Lambda has:
  - Dedicated IAM role with least privilege.
  - VPC-based egress filtering.
  - No persistent storage (ephemeral only).
- AWS Shield \+ WAF to prevent DDoS attacks.

### **3.3 Data Protection**

- AES-256 envelope encryption for stored tokens and secrets.
- All API traffic over HTTPS/TLS 1.3.
- Structured logging with PII redaction.

---

## **4. Data Model & Storage**

### **4.1 Entities**

- **Users**: Core identity and session data.
- **MCP Registry**: Metadata, OpenAPI spec links, tags, and owner.
- **Authorizations**: Linked third-party tokens with scope/expiry.
- **Executions**: Invocation payloads, responses, and performance metrics.
- **Feedback**: Ratings and developer-provided comments.
- **Logs**: Structured event logs with request IDs.

## **5. DevOps Pipeline**

### **5.1 CI/CD Steps**

1. **Developer Commit** → GitHub Actions triggered.
2. **Code Linting & Testing** → Pre-build validation.
3. **OpenAPI Validation** → Ensures MCP spec compliance.
4. **Security Scan** → SAST, dependency vulnerability check.
5. **Build Lambda Package** → Dockerized or ZIP build.
6. **Deploy to Staging** → Blue/green strategy.
7. **Integration Tests** → Automated runtime validation.
8. **Promote to Production** → Canary or full release.

### **5.2 Observability & Incident Response**

- CloudWatch Alarms for latency and error spikes.
- Datadog dashboards for live performance.
- Slack PagerDuty integration for incidents.
- Sentry for front-end and API error tracking.

---

## **6. Edge Cases & Failure Modes**

- **Expired Tokens**: Automatic refresh, fallback to reauthorization.
- **OAuth Consent Denial**: MCP invocation blocked with user notification.
- **Cold Start Delays**: Provisioned concurrency and scheduled warmups.
- **Registry Outage**: Cache-based failover for MCP metadata.
- **Execution Timeout**: Lambda configured for 30s max execution with fallback messaging.
