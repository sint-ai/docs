## **1 Threat Model**

### **1.1 Asset Categories**

- **Personal Data** – User memory vaults, documents, sensor data, wallet keys, and contextual metadata.
- **Model Intellectual Property** – Proprietary model weights, prompt chains, and fine-tuned behaviors.
- **Financial Credentials** – Keys and tokens used by autonomous agents for DeFi, payments, and trading.
- **Operational States** – Logs, orchestration flows, and runtime ephemeral data.

### **1.2 Threat Vectors**

| **Category**           | **Example Attack**                                       |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insider threats        | Cloud provider admin reading live memory                 |
| External attackers     | API key theft, container escape, GPU side-channel attack |
| Regulatory & legal     | Court orders forcing plaintext data delivery             |
| Malicious skills       | Marketplace agents exfiltrating user data                |
| Supply chain           | Compromised dependencies, malicious container images     |
| Quantum precomputation | Future risk to legacy cryptographic algorithms           |

### **1.3 Security Goals**

1. **Confidentiality** – Encryption at rest, in transit, and in use.
2. **Integrity** – Signed, attested, verified code only.
3. **Verifiability** – ProofReceipt logs every inference & training step.
4. **User Sovereignty** – ConsentPass revocation instantly halts data access.
5. **Regulatory Alignment** – Controls mapped to SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR.

## **2 Data Lifecycle & Architecture**

User → Edge Encryption → Walrus Immutable Storage → Nautilus CVM Runtime → ProofReceipt → Encrypted Output → User Client

## **3 Core Security Components**

### **3.1 CVM Mesh & Attestation**

- Multi-cloud CVM clusters with verified code and ephemeral workloads.
- Attestation artifacts committed to chain for public verification.
- GPU partitioning (MIG/IOMMU) preventing data leakage.

### **3.2 Selective Disclosure Engine**

- Policy-as-code DSL compiled to Move bytecode.
- Automatic redaction & consent validation before external calls.
- Zero data egress without explicit ProofReceipt authorization.

### **3.3 Secure Marketplace Sandbox**

- All skills run in isolated microVMs with seccomp-filtered syscalls.
- Pre-deployment scanning with Semgrep, Trivy, and AI code analyzers.
- Dynamic runtime monitoring using eBPF for anomaly detection.

### **3.4 ConsentPass Control Layer**

- NFT-gated, revocable data access.
- Revocation triggers immediate key shred and CVM halt.
- User-centric multi-tenant policies with fine-grained scope.

## **5 Compliance & Governance**

- Controls mapped to SOC2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and GDPR.
- Privacy impact assessments run quarterly.
- AI agent behavior sandbox logs for AI Act readiness (EU 2026).

## **6 Incident Response & Revocation Workflow**

1. ConsentPass panic burn executed (user or admin).
2. t-of-n validator threshold triggers shard destruction.
3. Runtime enclave halts due to attestation mismatch.
4. Walrus blobs remain ciphertext-only.
5. Full RCA and public post-mortem within 24 hours.
6. Incident feed shared via verifiable webhook to affected partners.

## **7 Deployment Models**

### **SaaS Cloud**

- Multi-region clusters (US, EU, APAC) on Sapphire Rapids CPUs & H100 GPUs.
- Infrastructure-as-code pinned base images.
- Auto-attestation for ephemeral job execution.

### **Enterprise Self-Host**

- Helm charts with integrated key custody.
- On-prem ConsentPass for data & runtime isolation.
- Air-gapped mode for critical industries (finance, healthcare).

```

- Gateway validates ProofReceipt and attestation before routing.
